If you know of any other businesses (or non-profits) that openly share their expenses (**not revenue!**), feel free to add them to the list by submitting a pull request. Make sure to include a short description of what the business does. Names should be ordered alphabetically.

When in doubt, file an issue.

If a description of your business _doesn't sound right_, do let me know. Likewise, if you don't want to see your name on this list, do let me know.
